# Visual-Sorting-Algorithms

## What Is This?
This is a webpage that shows various sorting algorithms in action, including BubbleSort, SelectionSort, InsertionSort, QuickSort, MergeSort and others.

## How Do I Use This?
Simply use the clearly labeled input boxes to control the various settings of the program, using these you can choose whether or not to use colour, the amount of detail shown for each sorting method, the interval of time between each draw call, the amount of values that will be sorted and the sorting type.

If you want to update the amount of values, change the value in the input box and press the generate button, this will create a new set of values of the size of your choosing.

To begin sorting, simply click the green 'Sort' button.
If you want to stop sorting at any point, press the red 'cancel' button that will replace the sort button when you begin sorting.

## Other Information
Updating the 'use colour', speed or interval settings will not cause the sorting to restart, these changes will take place immediately.
